#### Teaching Notes

*   For bootcamps that extend over more than two days (e.g. four afternoons spread over two weeks), it's a good idea to email the learners at the end of each day with a summary of what was taught (with links to the relevant online notes). Not only does this allow absent learners to catch up before the next session, it's also a great opporunity to present the lessons of the day in the context of the entire bootcamp.
