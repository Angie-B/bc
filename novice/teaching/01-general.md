#### Teaching Notes

*   For bootcamps that extend over more than two days (e.g. four afternoons spread over two weeks), it's a good idea to email the learners at the end of each day with a summary of what was taught (with links to the relevant online notes). Not only does this allow absent learners to catch up before the next session, it's also a great opporunity to present the lessons of the day in the context of the entire bootcamp.

*   Point learners at [http://software-carpentry.org/v5/](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/),
    which is the permanent home of the current learning materials,
    and at [http://software-carpentry.org/v4/](http://software-carpentry.org/v4/),
    which is where our previous materials live.
    The former corresponds to what they're being taught;
    the latter covers more ground in video as well as in slides and prose.
    They should also be direct to
    [Software Carpentry's FAQ](http://software-carpentry.org/faq.html).

    (b) has at least one badged instructor on the teaching roster,
    but are happy to discuss specifics.
