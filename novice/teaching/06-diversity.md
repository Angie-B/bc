As Katy suggested education about stereotype threat would be good.

Talking about unconscious bias would be good too.

In addition to the fact that we're talking about fundamental rights, we could bring up that diverse teams do better work.

On the topic of what not to do, the Women in Astronomy blog had an
excellent series of posts recently on sexual harassment. They are
collated here: http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com/2014/05/aaswomen-newsletter-for-march-16-2014.html

Short story : a patch seeking to gender-neutralize the google c++ test
framework documentation was submitted last night and grumpily
pooh-poohed this morning on the gtest listhost.

This one just popped back into my head: a personal account of leaving
the field of chemistry because of sexism:

1. A NYT article on microaggressions: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/us/as-diversity-increases-slights-get-subtler-but-still-sting.html?_r=1
2. This book, Whistling Vivaldi, was a key part of the reading I did in preparing to write the series of posts on stereotype threat: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393339726/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=17WPNNQ56GKFJ&coliid=IDHZ9U4RO0SX
3. This NYT Magazine article talks about efforts at UT-Austin aimed at improving retention and graduation rates:

1. Some of the discussion focused on how to handle tricky situations in the classroom. One suggestion (from Ann Curzan in English) is to focus on the language. For example, “The words you just used might give the impression that you think…” She recommended this video, entitled how to tell someone they sound racist:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc&feature=kp

The video is short and basically just says: Don’t tell someone they are racist; say that what they said sounds racist.

2. Probably the most useful thing we did related to this was a set of role-playing activities related to difficult classroom situations (e.g., one student responding to a role call asking for Lynda by saying ‘I would prefer to be called Justin and please use the pronoun he/him when referring to me’, followed by another student laughing in response to Justin’s request). I have to say that I’ve never been a big fan of role-playing (and am a terrible actor), but I found this set really useful in terms of thinking things through. Part of why it probably worked so well, though, was that everyone in the group had a lot of teaching experience. It might need to be tweaked for new instructors. I imagine CRLT would be able to help with this.
